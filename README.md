# Simon Says Game 🎮
## Overview : 
The Simon Says Game is a classic memory-based game where players must repeat a sequence of colors generated by the game. With each successful round, the sequence length increases, making it more challenging. The goal is to achieve the highest level possible before making a mistake.
This game helps improve concentration and memory skills while providing an interactive and fun experience.

## How the Game Works 🚀
**Game Start:** The game begins when the player clicks the "Start" button.<br>
**Sequence Generation:** A color blinks, indicating the first step in the sequence.<br>
**Player Interaction:** The player must click the color buttons in the same order as displayed.<br>
**Increasing Difficulty:** If the player repeats the sequence correctly, a new color is added to the pattern, increasing the level.<br>
**Game Over Condition:** If the player clicks an incorrect color, the game resets to level 1.<br>
